# CS 4731 Computer Graphics

Topics include graphics devices and languages, 2- and 3-D object representations, and various aspects of rendering realistic images. Students will be expected to implement programs which span all stages of the 3-D graphics pipeline, including clipping, projection, arbitrary viewing, hidden surface removal, and shading."
